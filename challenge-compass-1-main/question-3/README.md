# Question-3  Calculate  

Reading the "Challenge 1- Week 1 -- Question 3." document,  
I understood this software requirements to code:  

- Do only additions and subtractions with  
valid entries
- The first entrie is "m", the number of operands
- The second entrie is an arithmetic expression
- With the number of operands validated, the number  
of operations in the arithmetic expression must be "m-1"
- If the first and second entrie is valid,  
calculate the arithmetic expression
- Save the result
- While "m" is differs to 0, run the program
- When "m" is equal to 0, stop the run and  
print all the results of valid arithmetic expresions 
in the format "Test n", were "n" is the order  
of valid expressions

I have coded two fluxs on "Main", the first is using  
resources, the second is with prompt input.  
The first flux is the "default" run, to see others  
results, just change the content in "resources/testFile.txt".  
The second flux run if the first flux don't find the file,  
to run it delete the "testFile.txt".
