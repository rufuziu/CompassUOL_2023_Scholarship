# Question-5  MongoDB

I readed the "Challenge 1- Week 1 -- Question 5." document,  
and our instructors told to us to do this question with
three possibilities, I have understood that way:  
- Create the inserts using a Java object, doing the mapping
of the entities in the classes
- Create the insert via mongosh
- Create the insert's with a JSON

So I did using mapped entities  
inserting the content of a .json file  

To insert another registry change the values of  
"testFile.json" and run the application

*OBS: the string connection is my localhost with the default port*
