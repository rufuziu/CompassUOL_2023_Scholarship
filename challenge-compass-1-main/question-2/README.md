 # Question-2  (OBI-2020)

Reading the "Challenge 1- Week 1 -- Question 2." document,  
I understood this software requirements to code:  

- Read an entry
- After readed print the sentiment of the entry

I have coded two fluxs on "Main", the first is using  
resources, the second is with prompt input.  
The first flux is the "default" run, to see others  
results, just change the content in "resources/testFile.txt".  
The second flux run if the first flux don't find the file,  
to run it delete the "testFile.txt".
