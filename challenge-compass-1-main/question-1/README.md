# Question-1  SCOREBOARD  

Reading the "Challenge 1- Week 1 -- Question 1." document,  
I understood this software requirements to code:  

- The first entrie is the number of students in the competition  
must be between 1 and 100 
- The second entrie is the name and the number of problems solved  
(name letters[a-z] and length <= 20)  
(problems solved between 0 and 10)
- The program ends with end-of-file
- Print the student who solved less problems in the format  
"Instancia k", were k is the student instance, your name and  
the number of problems solved 
- If two students solved the same number of problems,  
the worst student will be decide by descendent alphabetical order

I have coded two fluxs on "Main", the first is using  
resources, the second is with prompt input.  
The first flux is the "default" run, to see others  
results, just change the content in "resources/testFile.txt".  
The second flux run if the first flux don't find the file,  
to run it delete the "testFile.txt".
